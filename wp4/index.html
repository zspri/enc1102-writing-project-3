                    Welcome to my ePortfolio website for English Composition II with Dr. Bergholtz for the Fall 2023 semester.
                    The objective of this site is to demonstrate competency and growth in the six course learning outcomes: Generating Inquiry, Information Literacy, Research Genre Production, Contributing Knowledge, Revision, and Multiple Ways of Writing.
                    In order to demonstrate each learning outcome, I will be including classwork and related material as well as an explanation as to why the completed coursework satisfies the outcome.

                        "The clearest instances of rhetorical speaking and writing are strongly invited - often required." I chose this quote because I think it drives Bitzer's statement about how rhetoric forms from exigences, or a strong need to change something about the world, and how it has the powerful ability to open the door to rectify difficult situations. This quote makes me think about how, while we as humans are animals just like any other, we have evolved to communicate with each other and resolve differences in a more civilized way; rhetoric is one of the tools that people employ to do so. It signifies that under some of the most dire or urgent events, the power of speech, through rhetoric, has the greatest ability to bring an outcome that benefits its constituents.
                        My question is, what about rhetoric makes it so powerful? Why do people choose to resolve their differences through speech rather than through some other method?

                        Ethics are very much situational--many different factors go into what we consider to be ethical. We may try to justify certain thoughts and actions as ethical or unethical with respect to our own obligations and opinions. We may not realize it, but we're constantly weighing different pathways and evaluating the world around us, and our own moral/ethical code guides us strongly.
                        In response to your question, rhetorical discourse is communication that arises from a rhetorical situation. As Bitzer mentioned, rhetorical discourse may often begin with some type of speech or address to the situation's audience, which then opens up further exchange. Ideally, this results a positive, favored outcome for the situation.

                        Annotated bibliographies allow you to keep a written record of your thoughts and analysis of several different sources. Their purpose is to help you determine whether a source is relevant and credible. Ultimately, they help you deepen your knowledge about your research subject.
                        Annotated bibliographies typically consist of a citation, a summary, and an evaluation. The citation should be formatted properly, the summary a neutral, 1-3 sentence abstract in your own words, and the evaluation a few sentences about why the article can be used in your research project. The evaluation should ask the following:
                        1. What information does this source contribute to your research question?
                        2. Does this source appear to be biased?
                        3. How can you use this source in your research project?
                        ---
                        Something that I don't know about annotated bibliographies is how in-depth I should go with my evaluation in order to effectively answer the above 3 questions. How should I balance how much information I outline in my evaluation without making it too long?
                        ---
                        Research proposals are created to convince someone (usually your boss or professor) that your research idea is valid and of value. Their purpose is to demonstrate your project's relevance and practicality. They explain your project's methods, justification, scope, and planned outcomes.
                        All research proposals should have:
                        1. A title page
                        2. An introduction designed to create interest in your project
                        3. A literature review that gathers existing findings related to the research topic, like reports and theories.
                        4. A research design section that outlines your procedures, methods, and project's overall design. It should describe whether your research is quantitative or qualitative, data sources, and any obstacles that may be encountered.
                        5. Implications on how your project may contribute to the confirmation, rejection, or formation of a theory, as well as the other impacts it may have on future research.
                        ---
                        Something that I don't know about research proposals is how many sources should be used. Will all the sources in the annotated bibliography be used for the proposal, or only some of them? What if I find new sources that I want to include after I create an annotated bibliography?

                <h3>Rationale</h3>
                <p>
                    QQC #1 required me to critically analyze Bitzer's <i>Rhetorical Situation</i> paper.
                    This document is the ultimate foundation for all of our projects in this class as it provides the basis for rhetorical speaking and writing and defines important attributes of the rhetorical situation, such as the audience, exigence, and constraints.
                    I used the information I learned from Bitzer's discussion into my later writing projects.
                    The Genre Discussion assignment helped me understand more about the specific constraints and requirements for annotated bibliographies and research proposals.
                    This provided a foundation for Writing Project 2, and later compounded to Writing Project 3.
                    It helped me decide my overall layout for the project and elements that I needed to ensure that readers of my proposal and bibliography could understand the sources I chose, why I chose them, and how they are relevant to my research topic.
                    Each of these assignments encouraged us to think critically about writing and genre.
