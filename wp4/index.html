                    Welcome to my ePortfolio website for English Composition II with Dr. Bergholtz for the Fall 2023 semester.
                    The objective of this site is to demonstrate competency and growth in the six course learning outcomes: Generating Inquiry, Information Literacy, Research Genre Production, Contributing Knowledge, Revision, and Multiple Ways of Writing.
                    In order to demonstrate each learning outcome, I will be including classwork and related material as well as an explanation as to why the completed coursework satisfies the outcome.

                    <p>
                        "The clearest instances of rhetorical speaking and writing are strongly invited - often required." I chose this quote because I think it drives Bitzer's statement about how rhetoric forms from exigences, or a strong need to change something about the world, and how it has the powerful ability to open the door to rectify difficult situations. This quote makes me think about how, while we as humans are animals just like any other, we have evolved to communicate with each other and resolve differences in a more civilized way; rhetoric is one of the tools that people employ to do so. It signifies that under some of the most dire or urgent events, the power of speech, through rhetoric, has the greatest ability to bring an outcome that benefits its constituents.
                        My question is, what about rhetoric makes it so powerful? Why do people choose to resolve their differences through speech rather than through some other method?

                        Ethics are very much situational--many different factors go into what we consider to be ethical. We may try to justify certain thoughts and actions as ethical or unethical with respect to our own obligations and opinions. We may not realize it, but we're constantly weighing different pathways and evaluating the world around us, and our own moral/ethical code guides us strongly.
                        In response to your question, rhetorical discourse is communication that arises from a rhetorical situation. As Bitzer mentioned, rhetorical discourse may often begin with some type of speech or address to the situation's audience, which then opens up further exchange. Ideally, this results a positive, favored outcome for the situation.

                <details>

                    <p>
                        Annotated bibliographies allow you to keep a written record of your thoughts and analysis of several different sources. Their purpose is to help you determine whether a source is relevant and credible. Ultimately, they help you deepen your knowledge about your research subject.
                        Annotated bibliographies typically consist of a citation, a summary, and an evaluation. The citation should be formatted properly, the summary a neutral, 1-3 sentence abstract in your own words, and the evaluation a few sentences about why the article can be used in your research project. The evaluation should ask the following:
                        1. What information does this source contribute to your research question?
                        2. Does this source appear to be biased?
                        3. How can you use this source in your research project?
                        ---
                        Something that I don't know about annotated bibliographies is how in-depth I should go with my evaluation in order to effectively answer the above 3 questions. How should I balance how much information I outline in my evaluation without making it too long?
                        ---
                        Research proposals are created to convince someone (usually your boss or professor) that your research idea is valid and of value. Their purpose is to demonstrate your project's relevance and practicality. They explain your project's methods, justification, scope, and planned outcomes.
                        All research proposals should have:
                        1. A title page
                        2. An introduction designed to create interest in your project
                        3. A literature review that gathers existing findings related to the research topic, like reports and theories.
                        4. A research design section that outlines your procedures, methods, and project's overall design. It should describe whether your research is quantitative or qualitative, data sources, and any obstacles that may be encountered.
                        5. Implications on how your project may contribute to the confirmation, rejection, or formation of a theory, as well as the other impacts it may have on future research.
                        ---
                        Something that I don't know about research proposals is how many sources should be used. Will all the sources in the annotated bibliography be used for the proposal, or only some of them? What if I find new sources that I want to include after I create an annotated bibliography?

                <h3>Rationale</h3>
                <p>
                    QQC #1 required me to critically analyze Bitzer's <i>Rhetorical Situation</i> paper.
                    This document is the ultimate foundation for all of our projects in this class as it provides the basis for rhetorical speaking and writing and defines important attributes of the rhetorical situation, such as the audience, exigence, and constraints.
                    I used the information I learned from Bitzer's discussion into my later writing projects.
                    The Genre Discussion assignment helped me understand more about the specific constraints and requirements for annotated bibliographies and research proposals.
                    This provided a foundation for Writing Project 2, and later compounded to Writing Project 3.
                    It helped me decide my overall layout for the project and elements that I needed to ensure that readers of my proposal and bibliography could understand the sources I chose, why I chose them, and how they are relevant to my research topic.
                    Each of these assignments encouraged us to think critically about writing and genre.

                        Discussion response

                    <p>
                        I chose "Content Analysis in the Research Field of Incivility and Hate Speech in Online Communication" by Katharina Esau on page 451.
                        This article focuses on researching hateful content online. This article might be useful to anyone who is researching the effects that negativity, hate speech, and uncivil behavior have on online discussions because it defines what qualifies as incivility, presents theories about incivility, and compares incivility to hate speech and impoliteness.
                        Key takeaways were:
                        Incivility is usually the result of discussion on a controversial topic
                        There are multiple dimensions of incivility, ranging from rudeness to sarcasm and offensive language
                        Hate speech is a subset of incivility targeted towards individuals based on their characteristics
                        This article has useful quotes because my project also deals with examining negativity in online communities. I could use the following quote to relate trends between negativity and the types of topics that are being talked about:
                        "incivility has been examined in the context of a variety of mostly highly controversial and conflictual topics. For example, Oz et al. (2018) demonstrated that significantly more impolite and uncivil user comments were published on sensitive, morally charged topics"
                    </p>

                    <summary>Response to peer</summary>
                    <p>
                        You had some good takeaways from the article. I agree that it's always a good idea to use reputable sources when quoting. It's important to evaluate where the information you're putting in your own papers is coming from. One thing that I think you could've clarified on is what methods analyses use when talking about technology, and how they relate to conclusions that the authors make.

                    In Writing Project 1, we had to find several academic sources which we had to evaluate for relevance and credibility.
                    We also had to summarize these sources and explain how they could be useful in our research projects.
                    In our discussion of <i>Standardized Content Analysis in Communication Research</i>, we had to analyze existing research articles and determine their methods and appeals for credibility.
                    We also explored whether we would be able to cite the article we selected in our own project.
                    Ultimately, both of these assignments helped us to practice evaluating outside sources for use in our projects.
                    They helped me to understand the importance of both primary and secondary sources, and how selecting the correct sources is a critical factor for creating a valid research paper.

                <p>
                    Writing Project 1 taught us about writing within the annotated bibliography and research report genres.
                    This provided the foundation for Writing Project 2 and created the basis for the constraints, audience, and exigence which we needed to account for.
                    Our list of sources and summaries from Writing Project 1 were used in our second project and influenced how we presented our argument, collected our data, and explained our results.
                    In Writing Project 3, we had to choose our own multimodal genre based on our work from Writing Project 2.
                    We then had to make choices about the design and layout of our multimodal project, and justify those decisions.
                    For example, I chose to create a website for my Writing Project 3.
                    In order to do so successfully, I needed to research the specific conventions and constrains that a website would be held to.
                    I then applied this information to my website, which helps me further specialize my message to my target audience.
                    My target audience for Writing Project 2 was online forum moderators.
                    Since all forum moderators use the internet to manage their communities, creating a website was the best course of action to target them since the website is conducted via the same medium of communication.

                    This set the foundation for conducting our own primary research in Writing Project 2, where we had to collect and analyze comments from an online community and draw conclusions about overall trends occurring in the community.
                    We then had to apply these trends to a broader scope beyond the community and relate our research questions to real-world problems.
                    Each of these projects required us to use critical thinking to draw conclusions using a combination of our own primary research, as well as affirming and/or conflicting information from external sources, ultimately helping us draw conclusions to our research questions.
                    We had to apply critical thinking skills to create new knowledge about our chosen topic.
                    This knowledge had to be relevant to real-world problems and applicable to our target audiences.

                <h3>Rationale</h3>
                <p>
                    Writing Project 2 is the ultimate example of revision: we had to complete three separate drafts of our research paper, starting from a rough beginning to a fully-polished and ready-to-be-published final product.
                    Along the process, we needed to incorporate feedback from our peers and the course instructor.
                    Draft 2 highlights my changes that I made after peer feedback.
                    My peer's main suggestions were to include a glossary for technical terms that the reader may not know the definition of, as well as refactoring some wordy and overly complicated sentences.
                    I took these suggestions into account when creating my second draft, and included a glossary and modified the problematic sentences.
                    In Draft 3, my course instructor offered final remarks and suggestions for the project.
                    These steps took my essay from a mostly-done state to one that could be published in a research paper.
                    Revision is important to understand your shortcomings and gain external perspective on aspects of your paper that you may not initially realize.
                    This process helped me to delibirately and effectively decide how to modify my paper to benefit the reader's understanding.

                <h3>Rationale</h3>
                <p>
                    For me, Writing Project 2 began to incorporate the principles of multimodality.
                    I started out by writing Python code (that I did not include in the final project) to assist me in conducting my primary research.
                    This code generated several graphs that I then included into my research paper.
                    The reason that I included Writing Project 2 in my artefacts list for this outcome is that the graphs generated were essential to explaining my research and data to the reader.
                    Writing Project 3 took this to the next level; I had to create a website for my research paper.
                    To take advantage of the multimodal nature of websites, I included more graphs and pictures into my paper, and changed the formatting of the website manually using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
                    These steps allowed me to present my research questions, methods, and conclusion in a more effective and easy-to-visualize manner.
                    Transforming my essay into a website also allowed me to take advantage of the medium that my audience would likely interact via&mdash;the internet.
                    Ultimately, using multiple ways of writing helped me to understand my audience better and how I can target them in a more effective way.
